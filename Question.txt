Write a C# program or function to check Harshad number 
(or Niven number). Your program should take one positive integer 
from the user as input and check whether this integer is Harshad number (Niven number) or not.
Harshad number or Niven number is a number which is divisible by the sum of its digits.

1) 21 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by the sum of its digits.

21 –> sum of digits –> 2+1 = 3 and 21 is divisible by 3 –> 21/3 = 7.
